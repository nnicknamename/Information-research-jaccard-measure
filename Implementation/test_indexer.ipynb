       "  'text': ' the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year .  the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space .  the practical question which required an answer was ..  would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm  this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated .   an ideal problem is here discussed .  a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form .  the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated .  it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air .   the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front .  as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate .  at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy .   in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment .

       "  'text': ' scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .   the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation .  for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible .   several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) .   the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge .  under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .   in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .

       "  'text': ' various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow .   this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .   results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .   in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction .   for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation .   results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .   calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .   for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory .   a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations . qualitative agreement is indicated .

(1) sharp leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature, and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory, and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical and experimental study .

(2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .   the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good .   a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper . \",\n",

       "  'text': \" atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle . the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is  considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section .  an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of  conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted, then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from equilibrium . it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected  by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated  to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing occurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more sensitive to departures from equilibrium . \",\n",

       "  'text': ' the bending of uniformly loaded clamped plate in the form of a circular sector .   the deflexion of a uniformly loaded plate in the form of a semicircle clamped along its boundary is obtained by a method due to weinstein .  this problem requires the solution of the biharmonic equation where z is given, subject to the conditions that w = 0 and on the boundary, n being the direction of the outward normal .  the solution is expressed in the form where, writing is found by solving (in succession) two harmonic equations of the forms where z may be zero, and where f and have to satisfy certain boundary conditions . the constants are then determined to satisfy the boundary condition .   numerical calculations show that five or six terms of the series give a good approximation to the accurate value as judged by the closeness with which the approximate solution satisfies the boundary condition .  the procedure to be adopted in the case of the general circular sector and for non-uniform loading is indicated briefly .   the connexion between the deflexion problem and that of plane strain in which the stress function satisfies the equation, where and have given values on the boundary, is discussed as a preliminary to the further consideration of the latter problem by a method of the same type .

       "  'text': ' the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression . in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts . by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory . this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started,. this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process . furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process .   in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression .  first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection .  then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine .

       "  'text': ' interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the  development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction  depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream  of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in  practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight  and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information  is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation  between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock  waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain  unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of  the paper .

(a similar, but not quite as general, method was derived by walkden in ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the volume term, has been used extensively to predict the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies and the agreement with experiment has, so far, been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft. altitude and the calculations of this paper show that under those conditions the shock noise of the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases, be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown that at higher altitudes lifting effects will dominate for even the small fighter and they will dominate over most of the altitude range for large bomber and supersonic transport aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases with altitude as which compares to in the volume case (=pressure at altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number, wing loading, wing plan shape and lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating the shock noise due to combined volume and lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to configurations with wings located towards the rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift) or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is presented from which rapid estimates can be made of the shock noise of lifting wing-body combinations . \",\n",

       "  'text': ' inelastic instability and incremental theories of plasticity .   a most troublesome paradox has existed for a number of years with respect to buckling in the plastic range .  theoretical considerations and all direct experimental evidence show conclusively that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theory of plasticity is valid .  however, the results of plastic buckling tests are well correlated by a simple total or deformation theory and bear no resemblance to published predictions of incremental theory .   the suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shape or loading might well explain this most peculiar result . however, subsequent investigations by several authors seem to have given the impression that excessively large imperfections would be needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to the magnitude of such imperfections .   it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely small, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do account for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load is shown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection . the example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangular plate hinged along one edge and free on the other under uniform compressive stress at the ends .  this is the equivalent of the case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbing in the past because incremental theory applied to a perfect cruciform column did lead to an entirely incorrect result .

(1) the effect of transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no counterpart in flat-plate theory .   the general results of this report have been applied to the solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .   the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse core flexibility .   the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .   solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .

       "  'text': ' a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells .   a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien .   in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs . these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .   experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated .

       "  'text': ' the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model . the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected  by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less  than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter . lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model . gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation  of the model .

       "  'text': ' investigation of normal force distributions and wake vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic speeds .   the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are discussed and analyzed .   comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with theories which include methods for estimating the effects of viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack . further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that, in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .   the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet . the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however, in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined from experiment .   the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are, in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination angles which are in good agreement with the measured values, except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet, and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and experiment .   it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are accurately known .

       "  'text': ' a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending .   the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .   in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data .   it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well .   the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .

       "  'text': ' the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed for two-dimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils .   advances in the practical development of boundary-layer control for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn attention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to artificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window panels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impact with insects .  this natural form of roughening, the effects of which have been noted, though not investigated previously, is the subject of the present paper .   the phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely, and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary layer .  wind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila, and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and airfoils are fully described .  the former problem has also been treated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published, agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in all essentials .   the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally of a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an extensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced and gradually diminishing value of the excrescence height .  further, it is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effect upon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the down-stream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of a laminar layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically smooth .  moreover, it appears that the conditions defining the upstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are fundamentally the same as those which determine the critical state for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three- dimensional character .

       "  'text': ' turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body at hypersonic speeds .   at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10 corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/ wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body . tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .   in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300 mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude . these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .

       "  'text': ' boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high temperature hypersonic flow . two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large down-stream influence of leading-edge bluntness . the present paper contributes new theoretical and experimental results on this problem . the interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending  the basic shock-layer concept . in the outer inviscid flow, a model consisting of a detached shock layer and an entropy layer is introduced to account for bluntness . in the boundary layer, the approximate solution is found to be governed by a local flat-plate similarity . under the assumption of a strong bow shock and a specific heat ratio close to unity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body . for flat-plate  afterbodies, the theory yields a solution agreeing with blast-wave theory at one limit and strong-interaction theory at the other . within the framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle of attack are also analyzed . complementary to the above study, a hypersonic similitude involving strong shocks, but not requiring close to one  a natural comparison with experimental data correlated on the basis of this similitude . flat-plate experiments in air, conducted in the c.a.l. 11 x 15-dashin. hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall conditions, included measurement  of surface heat-transfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero and nonzero angle of attack . steady laminar heat-transfer rates were measured by means of thin-film resistance thermometers at air test-flow mach numbers around 12, free-stream reynolds numbers from 1.4 x 10 to 1. for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from ratios of about 0.15 . the range of test conditions at this stagnation temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and dominant viscous-interaction effects . heat-transfer distributions were also measured on a sharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreek . the experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the foregoing theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects of boundary-layer displacement and bluntness . the correlations obtained  suggest that for the present experimental conditions, at least, the hypersonic viscous similitude is valid even with leading-edge bluntness  in the paper, is generally fair .
